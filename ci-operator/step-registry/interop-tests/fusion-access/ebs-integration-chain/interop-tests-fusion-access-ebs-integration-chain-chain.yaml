    EBS integration chain for Fusion Access testing with EBS filesystem.
    
    This chain provides the EBS-specific components for Fusion Access testing:
    - EBS volume creation: Creates and attaches 3x100GB gp3 EBS volumes per worker node
    - LocalDisk creation: Creates LocalDisk resources representing the shared EBS volumes
    - Filesystem creation: Creates IBM Storage Scale filesystem using LocalDisk references
    - Filesystem verification: Validates filesystem status and health
    - Cluster verification: Validates IBM Storage Scale cluster status
    - Functional testing: Runs comprehensive tests on deployed system
    
    This chain should be used after the shared deployment chain to complete
    the EBS-based Fusion Access deployment and testing.
    
    Prerequisites:
    - Shared deployment chain must complete successfully
    - IBM Storage Scale cluster must be ready
    - AWS cluster with worker nodes (using EBS volumes for storage)
