    CNV test chain for Fusion Access and CNV shared storage testing.
    
    This chain provides the CNV-specific components for shared storage testing:
    - CNV deployment: Deploy Container Native Virtualization
    - Shared filesystem creation: Local storage filesystem for CNV integration
    - CNV shared storage configuration: Configure CNV to use shared storage
    - CNV testing: Test VMs and DataVolumes with shared storage
    - Shared storage verification: Verify data sharing between CNV and Fusion Access
    
    This chain should be used after the environment setup chain to complete
    the CNV integration testing without EFS dependency.
    
    Prerequisites:
    - Environment setup chain must complete successfully
    - IBM Storage Scale cluster must be ready
    - CNV must be deployed and ready
    - Local storage must be available for shared filesystem creation
