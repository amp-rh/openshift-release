    Prepare worker nodes for IBM Storage Scale deployment.
    
    This step creates required directories on worker nodes that IBM Storage Scale
    kernel module build process (mmbuildgpl) expects to exist:
    - /var/lib/firmware - Required for kernel module compilation
    
    Without these directories, mmbuildgpl init container fails with:
    "rsync: change_dir /host/var/lib/firmware failed: No such file or directory"
    
    This step must run after:
    - Worker nodes are ready and labeled
    
    This step must run before:
    - IBM Storage Scale Cluster creation
