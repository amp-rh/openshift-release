    Verify IBM Storage Scale Operator status and behavior.
    
    This optional step validates the operator's reconciliation logic, secret creation behavior,
    and quorum detection. It helps distinguish between operator failures and expected waiting states.
    
    Tests include:
    - Operator pod health status
    - GUI SSH key creation (should succeed early)
    - Core SSH key creation (conditional on quorum)
    - Operator quorum detection logic
    - Secret creation dependency validation
